# Build Instructions

Due to configuration constraints, please use the following commands to build the application:

## Development Build
```
node build-dev.js
```

## Production Build
```
npm run build
```

## Running the Application
```
npm run dev
```

Note: The build process now uses Vite directly instead of TypeScript compiler to avoid conflicts between build options.
